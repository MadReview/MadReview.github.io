    <h2 style="color: rgb(250, 3, 3); font-size: 20px">ATTENTION!! This is my opinion on horror movies and if you do not agree with them thats fine or if after you watch these movies you disagree with me thats fine too! I also need to state that most of these movies are for mature audiences so viewer discretion is advised. Now listen to what I have to say!</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; border: black; border-style: dashed"> As Above So Below follows a team of explorers as they venture into the Paris Catacombs to uncover a dark secret and confront their own personal demons. My personal fear while watching this horror movie wasn’t a demon but rather the claustrophobic feel of the entire movie. In its found footage style the sense of motion sickness while watching plagues most viewers while the movie quickly begins to feel like a haunted-house attraction with cheap scares. The idea of battling your worst fears in a dizzying, confusing atmosphere sounds like a great premise, however, As Above So Below starts to feel more like a therapy session when the characters start trauma dumping in the midst of walking through a literal Hellmouth. Though the movie has its flaws it is one I will never stop recommending just so people can experience exactly what I experienced while watching…blatant confusion. I rate this movie a 5/10 skulls.</p>

    <p style=" font-size: 20px; border: black; border-style: dashed">Eight Legged Freaks is a campy, predictable, horror movie where the release of some toxic waste leads to some pretty large spiders. Starring people such as David Arquetta, Leon Rippy, Kari Wuhrer, and Scarlett Johansson. It makes you wonder if this movie is what directors referred to when choosing Johansson to play the infamous role of Black Widow. Though the movie is a clear homage to the 50s horror cinema, what it lacks in genuine scares and strange line deliveries, it makes up for in its goofy CGI spiders and comedy. The cartoon-like sound effects and subtitles such as “(spiders giggling)” help add to this movie's character that seems to not take itself too seriously, and make it an all around fun watch. However, if you plan on watching this movie I would suggest holding your furry friends at home a little closer (wink, wink). I rate this movie a 7/10 arach-attacks</p>

    <p style=" font-size: 20px; border: black; border-style: dashed">Patchwork is a fun, comedy, horror movie where three young women, who after a night of epic partying, find themselves attached together as a Frankenstein monster. With each of their personalities and consciousnesses now attached to their new body, the girls begin their hunt to find who exactly did this to them and seek their revenge. Patchwork has a lot more stitched into its skin than meets the eye, specifically in the way this movie eskews the stereotypes of women through complex and relatable female characters in an interesting and unique way. Not only that, but this movie creates just the right mixture of gory brutality in the name of revenge and goofy comedy that isn’t obnoxious. While watching this movie it introduced one of my favorite scenes and moments of horror cinema in the form of an owl-cat creature named Archimedes, I will not elaborate more just watch the movie. With that I highly recommend you check out this movie if you want to watch some good old horror comedy and girlboss shenanigans. I rate this movie an 8/10 Frankensteins.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px; border: black; border-style: dashed">In the movie Mercy Black it takes the classic horror Slender Man lore and combines it with influence from the viral horror copypasta Momo; a somewhat tired trope. The story follows a woman released from a psychiatric care facility fifteen years after being involved with the murder of a classmate, all in the hope of giving life to their “guardian angel”, Mercy Black. The movie has a poor script, strange pacing, and builds up the menacing entity that is Mercy Black only for her to be something not worth fearing for viewers. However, I will admit that the last 20 minutes are full of twists that you don’t expect and end up making up for some of the more dull moments of the movie. If you are interested in a horror movie not jam packed with jumpscares but has a somewhat large trend of psychotic children then I would highly recommend Mercy Black. In the words of Abby Lee Miller, “You were good, I’m waiting for you to be great”, and with that I rate this movie a 5/10 Slender Men pages.
